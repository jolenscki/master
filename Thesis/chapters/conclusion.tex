This Chapter, as announced before, has the purpose of summarizing the thesis' key findings and outlining the contributions of the work presented here to the state-of-the-art of the traffic forecasting field, as well as showing the limitations we found during the development of these complex models and addressing the possible future path to take to overcome them. It's divided into two parts: Section \ref{sec:summary} reviews the entirety of the thesis, highlighting its main points and contributions. Section \ref{sec:limitations_future} exposes the limitations faced and sets the future directions to expand upon these findings.
